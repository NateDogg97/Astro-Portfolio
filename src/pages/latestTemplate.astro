const paragraph1 = "The template was meticulously crafted to support customization in text, images, meta-data, and web sections, similar to the flexibility offered by Wordpress but built on company-specific templating software. The development required close collaboration with the Graphics Design team for the layout, then bringing that vision to life using fundamental web technologies while incorporating company branding throughout the design.";
const paragraph2 = "The primary challenge was the solo development effort, starting from a basic layout to creating a fully functional, aesthetically pleasing template. The use of only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript demanded innovative solutions for state management and the development of mini JavaScript libraries to enhance functionality without compromising page speed. This process was intricate and time-consuming, demanding a high level of creativity and technical proficiency.";
