const summary = "The Golf Tee Time Auto Booker is a project utilizing Python, Selenium, and JavaScript to automatically book golf tee times for users. Deployed on a DigitalOcean Droplet, this bot navigates golf club websites to secure desired tee times using cronjobs for scheduling. It addresses the inconvenience of manual booking by offering a faster, automated solution, subject to golf club permissions."

const paragraph1 = "The bot was designed to interact with golf club websites, logging into user profiles and booking tee times automatically. It operates on a server deployment model, running at predetermined times to ensure the user can secure their desired slot. The core technologies involved are Python for scripting, Selenium for web interaction, and JavaScript for additional functionality.";
const paragraph2 = "The primary challenge was mastering Selenium's capabilities to interact accurately with web elements, necessitating precise instructions for every potential scenario. Additionally, integrating a database to manage user preferences and crafting a user-friendly sign-up interface significantly increased the project's complexity. These challenges required thorough testing and a deep understanding of both the technologies and the booking processes of golf clubs.";
const paragraph3 = "The project has been suspended as the website raised some flags with running automated testing software to interact with their website with the permission of the user. As soon as I was informed that the golf club did not approve of this method of navigating their website, the project was turned off immediately. Regardless, I showcase this project to demonstrate my willingness and ability to think outside the box to fulfill real-world needs. Also, it proves that I do have a desire to expand my skill set and cross false borders to deliver value to the customer.";
