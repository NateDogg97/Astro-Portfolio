const paragraph1 = "This project was developed to fulfill a frequently requested customer need for linking Instagram accounts to ERS company profiles. It involved creating a user-friendly interface that initiates the oAuth flow, enabling users to authorize the app to access and display their Instagram posts. The backend infrastructure was built on Express.js and Node.js, with a NoSQL database handling the storage of access tokens.";
const paragraph2 = "One significant challenge was the solo development effort required to build a compatible oAuth library and integrate it with our Proxy API. Ensuring secure connections for local development and managing access tokens with a NoSQL database added layers of complexity. Additionally, developing a seamless user experience for account linking and post display, while working within the constraints of the Instagram Display Basic API, tested my problem-solving and technical skills.";
const paragraph3 = "The Instagram Feed Plugin has transformed how ERS users incorporate their Instagram activity into their business profiles. By overcoming technical hurdles and leveraging a stack of modern web technologies, this feature now enables users to enhance their online presence and share important business updates through their Instagram posts directly on their websites. The successful implementation of this feature highlights the importance of continuous innovation and responsiveness to customer needs in the digital landscape.";
