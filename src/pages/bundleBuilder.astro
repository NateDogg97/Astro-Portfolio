const summary = "Bundle Builder marks one of my many proud moments in front-end engineering, showcasing a blend of innovation, user experience design, and technical prowess. Using Svelte, Astro, and sophisticated state structures and state management, alongside the simplest cloud management with Digital Ocean spaces, this premium feature sought to provide users with an easy-to-use interface to manage package deals in their store. This project symbolizes a significant leap forward from its predecessor, offering a seamless and engaging interface for users to craft personalized item scenes."

const paragraph1 = "The Bundle Builder was conceived to address the limitations of the previous 'Packages' feature by offering a visually intuitive and user-friendly interface for creating item bundles. This feature integrates advanced search functionality, leveraging public APIs and a NoSQL database to manage item data reactively. The Svelte framework facilitates a dynamic user experience, allowing items to be manipulated on a canvas where they can be resized, moved, and layered to create a cohesive scene or package.";
const paragraph2 = "Embarking on the development of the Bundle Builder presented a series of formidable challenges, from developing a seamless general search functionality to managing complex data structures for real-time user interaction. The drag-and-drop functionality posed the most significant challenge, requiring intricate handling of pointer and click events, as well as managing the reactive states of data with Svelteâ€™s derived stores. Achieving a balance between functionality, user experience, and permissions-based data access demanded not only technical skill but also a deep understanding of user needs and expectations.";
const paragraph3 = "The Bundle Builder represents a meaningful step forward, born from a commitment to improvement and a desire to innovate. It seeks to remedy previous limitations by providing users with an intuitive and engaging way to create item bundles. As a project I hold in high regard, it reflects a milestone for ERS and a personal point of growth. It's a reminder of the potential that lies at the intersection of passion and technology.";
