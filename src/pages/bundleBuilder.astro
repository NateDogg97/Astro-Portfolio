const paragraph1 = "The Bundle Builder was conceived to address the limitations of the previous 'Packages' feature by offering a visually intuitive and user-friendly interface for creating item bundles. This feature integrates advanced search functionality, leveraging public APIs and a NoSQL database to manage item data reactively. The Svelte framework facilitates a dynamic user experience, allowing items to be manipulated on a canvas where they can be resized, moved, and layered to create a cohesive scene or package.";
const paragraph2 = "Embarking on the development of the Bundle Builder presented a series of formidable challenges, from developing a seamless general search functionality to managing complex data structures for real-time user interaction. The drag-and-drop functionality posed the most significant challenge, requiring intricate handling of pointer and click events, as well as managing the reactive states of data with Svelteâ€™s derived stores. Achieving a balance between functionality, user experience, and permissions-based data access demanded not only technical skill but also a deep understanding of user needs and expectations.";
const paragraph3 = "The Bundle Builder represents a meaningful step forward, born from a commitment to improvement and a desire to innovate. It seeks to remedy previous limitations by providing users with an intuitive and engaging way to create item bundles. As a project I hold in high regard, it reflects a milestone for ERS and a personal point of growth. It's a reminder of the potential that lies at the intersection of passion and technology.";
